# Introduction to HTML

## Getting Started

ðŸ‘‰ _Fork_ and then _clone_ this repo to your local computer

## Instructions

The Tech Returners Doctors Surgery has a hand-crafted HTML website in desperate need of some fixes to its tags. Currently, some HTML tags are correct, but in many places the tags have been replaced by invalid HTML `fixme` tags: `<fixme></fixme>` ðŸ˜®

Your task is to replace these `fixme` tags with more appropriate ones.

For example, instead of:

```HTML

<fixme>Tech Returners Surgery: Home</fixme>
```

Perhaps using an `<h1>` here would be appropriate?

```HTML

<h1>Tech Returners Surgery: Home</h1>
```

ðŸ’¡ In some cases, there will only be one answer. For example, remember that an HTML document has a single `html` tag wrapping the whole document after the DOCTYPE.

ðŸ’¡ But in other cases, there might be multiple valid tags - in which case, choose whichever seems most appropriate.

ðŸ’¡ **_Don't forget to check any HTML attributes are valid and accurate too!_**

## Tips and Tricks

On Mac/Linux you can open HTML files in the browser using the command line:

```
         $ open filename.html
```

Or alternatively for Mac and Windows, right click the HTML file and select "open with", then select the browser of your choice.

ðŸ’¡ You can find a list of different tags and explanations on when and where to use them on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element).

ðŸ’¡ If you get really really stuck, you can find some hints [here](./hints.md).

Happy coding! ðŸ™Œ
